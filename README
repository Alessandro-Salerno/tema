                          TXT GENERATOR AND FORMATTER 

    What is tema? 

        tema is a txt generator and formatter build upon the louvre markup 
        language <https://github.com/Alessandro-Salerno/louvre>. This 
        software can convert any louvre source file into a pretty plain text 
        file for the reader's enjoyment. In fact, this README is generated 
        with tema! 

    How to use it 

        tema can be used as a CLI utility with the following command: 

            tema <input file> 

        The output will appear in the console. You can use your shell's 
        redirection syntax to output the formatted document to a file: 

            tema <input file> > out.txt
